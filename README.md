- At the welcome screen, you are able to sign-up/log-in to your account.
- At the home page you can input a file name, description, and upload the actual file.
- The list will show a preview if it is an image file, or a file icon if it is another type of file.
- Once the file is successfully uploaded to Firebase, you can then click the ***Download*** link to preview/download the file.
